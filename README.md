## **About the Project**

This project was developed as part of the **Tópicos Especiais** game development class. The objective was to create a small 3D platformer game that incorporates the following:

- **Two Levels:** The game includes two distinct levels, each with unique challenges and layouts.
- **Health and Death System:** The player has a health system that decreases upon taking damage. If health reaches zero, the player dies, triggering a death screen.
- **Collectables:** The game features collectable items (e.g., coins) that the player can gather to increase their score.
- **Player Movement:** The player can move, jump, and perform special actions like rolling, which temporarily disables collisions and adds dynamic movement.
- **Enemy Interactions:** Enemies patrol the levels, and the player can defeat them by jumping on them or avoiding them to prevent damage.
- **Camera System:** A camera follows the player to ensure smooth gameplay and visibility of the level.

This project demonstrates the application of fundamental game development concepts, including physics, animations, UI management, and scripting in Unity. It serves as a practical exercise in creating a complete, functional game with multiple mechanics and systems.
